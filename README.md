# Starter Kit for your first REST API in JavaScript.

    This codebase should serve for someone who wants to create his or her first RESTful API.
    If you want to build API without this repository, I recommend the following contents on YouTube!

# Background

    I had given a 45min Tech Talk in Tokyo for "Build your API in 30 min".
    for those who has the basic knowledge of JavaScript but non-programmers.
    There I introduced a case study of building a Unofficial Sake Library.
    And this repository is meant to be the follow-up of my Talk.
