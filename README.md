# Starter Kit for your first REST API in JavaScript.

    This codebase should serve for someone who wants to create his or her first RESTful API.

# Background

    I had given a 45min Tech Talk in Tokyo for "Build your API in 30 min".
    for those who has the basic knowledge of JavaScript but non-programmers.
    There I introduced a case study of building a Unofficial Sake Library.
    And this repository is meant to be the follow-up of my Talk.
